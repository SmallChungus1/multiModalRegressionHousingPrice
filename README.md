My work on a CatBoost based housing regression model on a multimodal (tabular-numerical, image, and textual) house price dataset. I utilized pre-trained vision-language model (CLIP) to generate features from images and pre trained BART transformer to generate features from textual descriptions. I combined these generated features and trained the CatBoost model that performed in the top 10 for our class's kaggle competiton.
